## 🔌 Control GPIO & PWM. Visually. Easily.

GpioFlow is a commercial software solution that allows you to control Raspberry Pi GPIO pins
through a modern, web-based user interface — no programming required.

Create interactive control panels using buttons and images, define GPIO actions,
and automate timed pin behavior with just a few clicks.

## ❓ The Problem

Controlling GPIO pins usually requires:
- Writing custom scripts
- Technical knowledge
- Hard-coded user interfaces
- Manual changes for every new setup

This makes rapid prototyping and user-friendly control difficult.
